# NES
Neural Eikonal Solver: framework for solving the eikonal equation using neural networks

What is available:
  1) One-Point NES (NES-OP) for solving one-point eikonal equation 
  2) Two-Point NES (NES-TP) for solving one-point eikonal equation 


```python
solver = NES.NES_OP(xs, velocity)
```
